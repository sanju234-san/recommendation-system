# recommendation-system
Just built a Content-Based Recommendation System using Python and Streamlit!
Say hello to smarter suggestions — whether it's movies, shows, or any content, this system finds what you’ll love next based on your preferences! 🎥📊

🔍 Project Highlights:

TF-IDF Vectorizer for content similarity

Cosine similarity to match titles

Streamlit interface for live recommendations

Clean, beginner-friendly, and interactive!

This project helped me explore the core of machine learning, text processing, and personalized AI experiences.
